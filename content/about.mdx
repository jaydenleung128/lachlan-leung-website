Lachlan Leung was a Year 12 student, a son, a brother, a teammate, and a friend — someone who made every room brighter simply by being in it. After a courageous twelve-month battle with a rare and aggressive brain cancer, Lachlan passed away peacefully in his sleep on the morning of 7 January 2026, surrounded by his loving family. He was 17 years old.

From an early age — his first recorded competition was in September 2015, when he was just six years old — Lachlan showed extraordinary talent and dedication as a table tennis player. He trained with discipline and focus that belied his age, rising through the ranks over nearly a decade to become one of the best young players in the country. By January 2025, he was ranked **5th in Australia in the Under 17 Boys** category and **32nd nationally in Open Men** — competing against Australia's best players of all ages. He reached a career-high rating of 1741 in September 2024.

Playing for **St George Table Tennis**, Lachlan competed at the highest levels of Australian junior and open table tennis. He was a regular at the **Australian National Championships** — appearing in 2019, 2022, 2023, and 2024 — as well as the NSW Closed and Open Championships, the NSW City v Country representative event, the ACT Open Championships, and TTA Tour events across the country. Those who watched him play remember not just the results, but the way he carried himself: with integrity, genuine sportsmanship, and a commitment to fair play that embodied the true spirit of the game.

But Lachlan was far more than his ranking. He excelled in his academic studies, was a respected and active member of his school community, and was known above all for his kindness, generosity, and willingness to lift up those around him. He gave his time freely, supported his teammates without reservation, and was deeply respected by everyone who crossed his path.

Lachlan had a great love for life, his family, and his friends. He faced his illness with the same courage and quiet determination he brought to the table — never giving up, always present, always himself.

He will be forever cherished and profoundly missed.
