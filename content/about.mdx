Lachlan Leung was a dedicated table tennis player whose passion for the sport was matched only by his warmth toward everyone he met. From an early age, Lachlan showed remarkable talent and determination, rising through the ranks to represent his state on the national stage.

Beyond the table, Lachlan was known for his infectious laugh, his generosity of spirit, and his ability to make every person in the room feel seen and valued. His teammates remember him as someone who pushed them to be better — not through pressure, but through example.

He found joy in the small things: early morning training sessions, the satisfaction of a perfectly executed serve, long drives to tournaments with friends, and the community that formed around a sport he loved deeply.

Lachlan's life was too short, but it was lived fully and with great love. He leaves behind family, friends, teammates, and coaches whose lives were made richer for knowing him.
