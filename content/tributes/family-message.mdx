Lachlan brought light into every room he entered. As a family, we watched him grow from a curious little boy into a young man of exceptional character — kind, funny, fiercely loyal, and quietly determined.

Table tennis was more than a sport to Lachlan. It was where he found his people, his rhythm, and his confidence. We are endlessly grateful to every coach, teammate, and friend who supported him and loved him along the way.

The house is quieter now. But we carry him with us every day — in the way we cheer for underdogs, in the way we show up early and stay late, in the way we never give up on a hard point.

We love you, Locky. Always.
