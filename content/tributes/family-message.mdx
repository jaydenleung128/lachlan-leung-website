Locky, you left before your story was finished,<br/>
Before you had the time you deserved.<br/>
You were caring and wise, mature beyond your years,<br/>
With a gentle humour that made people feel at ease.

You noticed others, helped without being asked,<br/>
And lifted people quietly, never seeking attention.<br/>
In table tennis, gaming, K-Pop, arcades, pool and fishing,<br/>
You excelled and brought joy to those around you.

With family, you brought us together with love,<br/>
A presence that connected us.<br/>
We are honoured to have you in our family.

We were not ready for the quiet you left behind,<br/>
But you will always be in our hearts.<br/>
Wrapped in the love of your family and friends, forever.
